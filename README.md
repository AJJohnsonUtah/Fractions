# Fractions - A Lesson
I created this project to teach beginner Java students about basic object-oriented development practices. It contains:

* A simple Fraction class with several stub methods, left for students to implement
* A suite of unit tests to verify the correctness of students' Fraction implementations
* A skeleton BigNumber class with tests and stub methods left for the student to complete
